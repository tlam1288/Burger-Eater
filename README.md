# Burger-Eater

Who doesn't love a good burger? Burgers come in a variety of styles. With this application you can make as many of your own burgers as you want and when you're ready you can devour them! Sometimes a burger is so good you want to eat it twice. You're in luck because you can do that too. When you're finished you can delete your burger off the list.

## How it works

To start the application off the user needs to enter a burger. That input will be added to the New Burgers list. 2 buttons next to their burger will allow them to eat it or delete it. If they chose to eat it then their burger will be moved to the devoured burgers list. They then have the option to eat it again, moving the burger back to the new burgers list or they can delete it. The Burger Eater stores user inputs into a MySql database and using and orm and handlebars their choices are rendered to the page.
